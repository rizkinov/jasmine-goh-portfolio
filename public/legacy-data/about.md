I’m Jasmine, a UX/Product Designer based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I specialise in bridging the tenets of design thinking, research based data, and user needs to create impactful design solutions for people and businesses.

When I’m not designing, I enjoy gaming and not being very good at learning the drums!
