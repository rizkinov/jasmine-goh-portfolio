# Virtual Banking  Experience for Children

UI/UX Case Study

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/3HwULXsTudKqqtw5BxnWAn9ph2U.jpg)

### Overview

This case study touches upon how can we create a digital banking experience for children as young as 6 years old; allowing them to start banking on their own.

This study takes into account the age range of the **primary target users (children)** with guided access from the **secondary target users (parents)**, and the financial as well as cultural aspects of the demographic region.

### Research

In order to build a product and experience revolving around digital technology, money and children, it’s important to first understand about our target user behaviour. Spending and shopping online, transferring money using apps or computers may seem almost like second nature to us adults, but one may wonder how much exactly can a child comprehend and navigate around money and technology, especially in this day and age.

#### Financial Literacy

Many children receive a regular “income” in the form of ‘pocket money’ and thereby, many children’s understanding of income is shaped by this cultural practice. Hence, there is already some form of exposure to the concept and value of money.

In fact, one study from the University of Cambridge found that

## **money habits in children were formed by the age of 7**

Source: “Habit Formation and Learning in Young Children” by Dr. David Whitebread and Dr. Sue Bingham University of Cambridge.

Children ages 8-12 exhibit new skills and thought patterns, and by the end of this developmental stage, they should achieve the milestone of logical thought, allowing them to understand the concept of cashless money transactions.

#### Tech Savviness

Today’s young children are brought up exposed completely to technology, giving rise to the term “digital natives”. Children aged 3-5 tend to spend around 4 hours per day with technology. Other age groups are showing an increase in the amount of time spent as well.

Statistics tell us that 45% of 8-11 year olds use social networking sites. Many parents admit to asking their children and teenagers for help with problems on their phones or tablets, and even younger children demonstrate remarkable skills with computers.

In research by Ofcom,

## over 50% of children aged 6-15 responded that they are able to use and know a lot a bout apps on smartphones or tablets.

### User Research

As this experience will be an introductory exposure to children on their first financial management learning, a lot of hand-holding from parents/guardian is to be expected. Also, as they are not adults yet, parent/guardian supervision and permission are legally required.

#### Hence, this experience is not limited to just children but also extends to those of parents and guardians as users.
