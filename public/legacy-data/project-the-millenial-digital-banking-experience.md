# The Millennial Digital Banking Experience

UI/UX Case Study

Note: This case study was done in July 2020 (before the new launch of MAE e-wallet as a separate app from Maybank2U in Oct 2020).

### Subject Study

#### Maybank2U

Maybank’s M2U app is by far one of Malaysia’s leading and forward-moving banking app among traditional banks. With features like QRpay and recently last year, a new e-wallet MAE as an addition, it is definitely one of the more go-to apps for Millennials when it comes to digital banking.

This case study touches upon how can we reimagine Maybank2U’s digital consumer banking experience for Millennials with the rise of digital financial services and growing interest in virtual banks and FinTechs.

### Inference

As smartphones are now considered a staple in most Millennials’ fundamental necessities, digital financial services apps are more driven towards creating more lifestyle-centric features to accommodate cashless transactions. E-wallets are slowly becoming a norm with cashless transactions being preferable in shopping, dining, travel, gaming, etc.

#### With Maybank being a bank in itself with an E-wallet feature, there is great potential in leveraging it to cater to Millennials with more lifestyle-centric features while also being the leading digital banking provider.

While **Maybank2U** has also already an existing platform with various lifestyle digital products, from this research we can infer that **MAE** as an E-wallet within M2U, has great potential to offer Millennials plenty of Lifestyle products in bite-size.

### Redesign & Prototype

Privacy and security are important. Users should feel at ease and comfortable when opening the app in a public space without having to worry about their sensitive information like their savings amount being exposed.

A Hide/Unhide function is added where users will no longer have to feel uncomfortable opening the app while queuing at a store to make payment. Users may also switch to Show All to reveal all amounts in accounts.
